Difference between static and dynamic website.

Static -> A static website is one with stable content, where every user sees the exact same thing on each individual page. A static website is made up of webpages created using HTML, CSS and Javascript
.Each page on a static website is stored as a single HTML file, which is delivered directly from the server to the webpage exactly as is.
This content essentially becomes a part of the design on your page, and won’t change unless the original HTML file is edited at a code level.

Dynamic ->Built using server side language and technology, dynamic websites allow for the content of each page to be delivered and displayed dynamically, or on-the-fly, according to user behavior or from user-generated content. 
With a dynamic website all of your data and content are organized in a database or backend Content Management System (CMS), which connects to your website pages. The way this information is arranged and connected to your site’s design controls how and when its content is revealed on a page.
